# DSA1101
R script for DSA1101 exams

This code is forked from Russell's DSA1101 repo, the original script can be found there.

This script is modified specifically for exam purposes, making it easier to solve exam questions with brain-dead plug-and-chug.

Credit goes to Russell, who authored the original script and the rest of the resources which can be found in the original repo. All I did was modify a few things and add a few functions.
